## Disclaimer
This repo is only for learning purposes to allow for us(The "COMMUNITY") to be able to track any and all changes to the DayZ SA server and client. If any other pbo needs to be added, just request on the discord. I am open for additions as we learn about new edits to do!

## Instructions
Check out any commit marked with the words "Update" in it, as it will be the update showing what BI changed. If you are a server host, you can pay attention to the Official Updates so that its easier to update your own server's modifications without messing up too badly.
